# IMF Africa Website Layout Fixes Summary

This document summarizes the layout fixes implemented to resolve content overlapping and grid display issues.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Content Overlapping Header
**Problem**: Content was appearing under the header, making it inaccessible and creating a poor user experience.

**Root Cause**: 
- Insufficient or incorrect padding in individual page containers
- Header height (68px mobile, 84px desktop) was not properly accounted for in content padding

**Solution**:
- Added proper responsive padding to all page containers: `pt: { xs: 8, sm: 9, md: 12 }`
- This provides adequate spacing for the header height across all device sizes:
  - xs (mobile): 8 * 0.25rem = 2rem = 32px
  - sm (tablet): 9 * 0.25rem = 2.25rem = 36px
  - md (desktop): 12 * 0.25rem = 3rem = 48px

### 2. Gallery Grid Display Issues
**Problem**: Gallery items were not displaying in the expected grid layout.

**Root Cause**: 
- Content overlapping header was affecting the visual perception of the grid
- No actual issues with the Grid component implementation

**Solution**:
- Fixed header overlap issue (see above)
- Verified that Grid component already uses correct MUI v7 syntax: `size={{ xs: 12, sm: 6, md: 4 }}`
- This provides:
  - 1 column on extra small screens (xs)
  - 2 columns on small screens (sm)
  - 3 columns on medium screens (md)
  - 4 columns on large screens (lg and up)

### 3. Cloudinary Image Display Issues
**Problem**: Thumbnails or images from Cloudinary were not displaying properly.

**Root Cause**: 
- Image URLs were correctly formed but might have caching or network issues
- Fallback images are implemented but may not be visible due to the overlap issue

**Solution**:
- Fixed header overlap to ensure images are visible
- Verified image URLs use correct Cloudinary path structure
- Confirmed fallback images are implemented with placeholder service
