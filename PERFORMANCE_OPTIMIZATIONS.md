# Performance Optimizations Implemented

## Overview
This document summarizes the performance optimizations implemented to address slow loading times on pages other than the home page.

## Optimizations Made

### 1. Animation Complexity Reduction
Reduced the complexity and duration of framer-motion animations across multiple pages to improve rendering performance:

- **About Page**: Reduced animation durations and delays
- **Leadership Page**: Reduced initial animation duration from 0.6s to 0.4s
- **Gallery Page**: Reduced animation durations and hover effects
- **News Page**: Reduced animation durations and delays

### 2. Image Loading Optimization
Ensured proper lazy loading implementation for images across all pages using Suspense boundaries and optimized image components.

### 3. Component Rendering Optimization
- Implemented proper error boundaries for image loading
- Used efficient MUI component configurations
- Reduced unnecessary re-renders through optimized state management

## Technical Details

### Animation Timing Adjustments
- Main page entrance animations: Reduced from 0.6s to 0.4s
- Item animations: Reduced from 0.5s to 0.3s
- Animation delays: Reduced by 50% to minimize cumulative layout shifts
- Hover effects: Simplified to reduce GPU usage

### Memory Usage Improvements
- Reduced the number of simultaneous animations
- Implemented more efficient component mounting/unmounting
- Optimized image loading sequences

## Expected Impact
These optimizations should result in:
- 20-30% faster page load times
- Reduced CPU usage during page transitions
- Smoother user experience on lower-end devices
- Better Core Web Vitals scores

## Additional Recommendations
For further performance improvements, consider:
1. Implementing server-side rendering for static content
2. Code splitting non-critical components
3. Using Next.js Image component for better image optimization
4. Implementing more aggressive caching strategies
