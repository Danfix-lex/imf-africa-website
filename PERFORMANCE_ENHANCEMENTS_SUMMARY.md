## Technical Implementation Details

### Next.js Configuration
Enhanced configuration with:
```typescript
images: {
  domains: ['res.cloudinary.com'],
  deviceSizes: [640, 750, 828, 1080, 1200, 1920, 2048, 3840],
  imageSizes: [16, 32, 48, 64, 96, 128, 256, 384],
  formats: ['image/webp'],
},
experimental: {
  optimizeCss: true,
  turbo: {
    rules: {
      "*.svg": {
        loaders: ["@svgr/webpack"],
        as: "*.js",
      },
    },
  },
},
```

### Cloudinary Optimization
Implemented optimized image transformations:
```typescript
thumbnailUrl = cloudinary.url(resource.public_id, {
  width: 400,
  height: 220,
  crop: "fill",
  format: 'webp',
  quality: 'auto',
});
```

### API Caching
Enhanced API route with ETag-based caching:
```typescript
const etag = `"${Buffer.from(dataString).toString('base64')}"`;
headers: {
  'ETag': etag,
  'Cache-Control': 'public, max-age=300, stale-while-revalidate=600',
}
```

### Lazy Image Component
Created reusable lazy loading image component:
```typescript
const LazyImage = ({ src, alt, sx, onError }) => {
  const [loaded, setLoaded] = useState(false);
  return (
    <Box
      component="img"
      src={src}
      alt={alt}
      sx={{
        ...sx,
        opacity: loaded ? 1 : 0,
        transition: 'opacity 0.3s ease',
      }}
      onLoad={() => setLoaded(true)}
      onError={onError}
    />
  );
};
```
