# Render Deployment Fix Summary

## Issue Description
The Render deployment was failing with a TypeScript error in the animations-demo page:
```
Type error: No overload matches this call.
  Overload 1 of 2, '(props: { component: ElementType<any, keyof IntrinsicElements>; } & GridBaseProps & { sx?: SxProps<Theme> | undefined; } & SystemProps<...> & Omit<...>): Element | null', gave the following error.
    Property 'component' is missing in type '{ children: Element; item: true; xs: number; sm: number; md: number; key: number; }' but required in type '{ component: ElementType<any, keyof IntrinsicElements>; }'.
```

## Root Cause
The issue was related to the Grid component usage in MUI v7. The error was indicating that the Grid component was missing the required `component` property, which suggests there might have been a mix of old and new Grid component syntax or a TypeScript definition issue.

## Fix Applied
1. Added explicit `component="div"` props to all Grid components in the animations-demo page:
   - Added to the main container Grid: `<Grid container component="div" spacing={4}>`
   - Added to the inner container Grid: `<Grid container component="div" spacing={4} sx={{ mt: 2 }}>`
   - Added to individual item Grids: `<Grid component="div" size={{ xs: 12, sm: 6, md: 4 }} key={index}>`
   - Added to feature Grids: `<Grid component="div" size={{ xs: 12, md: 4 }} key={index}>`

## Additional Context
This fix ensures that:
1. All Grid components have the required `component` property
2. The Grid components are properly typed for MUI v7
3. The animations-demo page will compile correctly in the Render deployment environment

## Verification
After applying these changes, the application should build successfully in Render. The fix maintains all existing functionality while resolving the TypeScript compilation error.
