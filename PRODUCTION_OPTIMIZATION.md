# Production Optimization Guide for IMF Africa Website

## Performance Improvements Implemented

### 1. Image Optimization
- Replaced `CldImage` components with regular `img` tags for better performance
- Added proper error handling with fallback images
- Implemented direct Cloudinary URLs with optimization parameters

### 2. Animation Optimization
- Reduced excessive use of framer-motion animations
- Kept only essential animations for user experience

### 3. Console Log Cleanup
- Removed development-only console.log statements
- Kept only critical error logging

## Additional Optimization Recommendations

### 1. Build and Deployment
```bash
# Build the application for production
npm run build

# Start the production server
npm run start
```

### 2. Image Optimization Best Practices
- Use appropriately sized images (don't load 2000px images for 300px displays)
- Implement lazy loading for images below the fold
- Use WebP format when possible

### 3. Code Splitting
- Review large component bundles
- Consider dynamic imports for heavy components

### 4. Caching Strategy
- Implement proper HTTP caching headers
- Use CDN for static assets

### 5. Monitoring in Production
- The PerformanceMonitor component is already configured to hide in production
- It will not appear when NODE_ENV=production

## Environment Variables for Production
Ensure these are set in your production environment:

```
NODE_ENV=production
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloudinary_cloud_name
PORT=10000
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://your-api-url.com
```
